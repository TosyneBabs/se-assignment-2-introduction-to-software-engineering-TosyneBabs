# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): it applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems. Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This model involves repetitive cycles of development, allowing for feedback and improvement in each iteration.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile is open to adaptation, encourages experimentation and welcomes changes of direction, even in later phases of the project. Because of this, the budget tends to be more flexible. Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders' needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering: Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems: Properly planned and executed testing is invaluable for reducing project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management: Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: Software project manager's responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
addictive design,
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and
overemphasis on features
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
